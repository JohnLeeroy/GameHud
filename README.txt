Integration
Copy GHAnalytics and GUID.lua to your project.  Use main.lua as a reference for the public function calls to send events as well as player and device information.  In the Init function, just be sure to replace the "insert_api_key" string with your game's api_key (found on the game settings page in GAMEhud).
